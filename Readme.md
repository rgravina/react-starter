# React Starter

This is a simple React.js starter project, using just the essentials for getting an app and unit testing working.

From here you can add whatever you like to your `package.json`. One approach you could take for starting a new project.

* Download an archive of this repository.
* `git add .` all the files (the `.gitignore` will ignore `node_modules` etc.)
* `git commit` as the start of your project
* Get developing!

Uses:

* `babel`, `webpack` and `html-webpack-plugin` for creating a deployable HTML/JS directory.
* `webpack-dev-server` for local development.
* `mocha`, `expect` and `enzyme` for testing.

```
npm install  # install all the dependencies
npm test     # you should see one passing unit test
npm start    # you should be able to see "Hello, World!" in your browser
```
